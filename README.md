# About

This website provides a simple implementation of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. Here, you play against the computer and you have the freedom to make the first move and pick your playing symbol. 

The game implements the **Mini-Max algorithm** for the computer to choose an optimal move after you make your move. I dare you to win against the computer.

> `Note` This project is open for contribution. You may fork it for adding new functinalities like implmenenting **Alpha-Beta Pruning** or adding an option of a **two-player gameplay** (where the computer does not play).
